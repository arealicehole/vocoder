# üìù Prompt (Option B ‚Äî Transition from A)

```text
We have a working one-shot hotkey dictation script (Option A). 
Now extend it into Option B:

- Build a persistent daemon called `vocoder` (systemd user service)
- Provide a CLI client `vocoderctl` that sends commands to vocoder
- Maintain pipeline: record ‚Üí transcribe via Whisper ‚Üí type with wtype
- Improve latency by keeping Whisper hot
- Support push-to-talk workflow with start/stop commands
- Deliverables: 
  - `bin/vocoder` (daemon)
  - `bin/vocoderctl` (client)
  - `daemon/vocoder.service` (systemd unit)
