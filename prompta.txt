# 📝 Prompt (Option A)

```text
Build a Linux hotkey-driven dictation script:

- Environment: GNOME on Wayland
- Flow: Hotkey → sox records → send to local Whisper Tiny API → type text with wtype
- Requirements: 
  - Must type directly into focused text box (not clipboard)
  - Silence-based auto-stop
  - Works with systemd-activated ydotool or fallback to wtype
- Deliverables: a single bash script `scripts/whisper-dictate.sh`, plus GNOME gsettings keybinding config
